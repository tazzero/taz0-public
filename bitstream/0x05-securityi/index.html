<h3 id="what-is-security">What is security</h3>
<ul>
<li>00:02:05 What is security: Security VS Safety.
<ul>
<li>Security: unexpected events that go back to an actor,</li>
<li>Safety: maintaining a status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>00:07:20 Entropy: things decay. Security is not a natural state, but
must be maintained.</li>
<li>00:09:10 Evil people: psychpaths, predators.</li>
<li>00:09:50 Circumstances: acting irrationally.</li>
<li>00:10:25 Hackers: Red Hats, joy of overcoming security systems.</li>
<li>00:11:11 WASP Privilege: no exposure to threats, stuff works most of
the time, no incentive to learn about security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="systems">Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>00:12:29 High trust society VS low trust society: Low trust comes
with high cost and less functional societies.</li>
<li>00:16:16 Symptoms of societies with low trust: different
environments are what make them.</li>
<li>00:16:50 Universal core values of humans: self-preservation,
protecting family and friends, private zones, no drama.</li>
<li>00:18:05 High trust society needs maintenance, will get eroded
quickly by few “bad actors”.</li>
<li>00:19:05 How can you turn a low security, low trust environment into
a high security, high trust environment? Parallel developments also
possible: high security, low trust societies.</li>
<li>00:19:40 Trust builds from history of interactions.</li>
<li>00:20:13 To change, bad memories must die (social memory). See
Thomas Kuhn (1962): The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</li>
<li>00:22:10 Western states want to make people dependent on security
(stateism) and increase state control. Thus, individuals externalize
security, and state is presented as the White Knight.</li>
<li>00:25:15 Are we being played/gamed/manipulated by the state and
state actors?</li>
<li>00:27:38 Just doing our jobs.</li>
<li>00:29:50 Machiavellianism: concepts how states can work.</li>
<li>00:31:20 Hegelian concepts: totalist and collectivist states and
politics.</li>
<li>00:33:20 Look at systemic issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="institutions">Institutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>00:33:30 Inspecting institutions: 1) Police.</li>
<li>00:39:00 Policemen’s selection bias: everyone is a potential
criminal or at least a suspect.</li>
<li>00:40:20 Documentation work of police activity by example of firing
weapons.</li>
<li>00:42:30 Bureaucracy can work.</li>
<li>00:47:30 Police in uniform VS civilian police: both are for peace
preservation.</li>
<li>00:48:00 Military is directed outwards.</li>
<li>00:49:00 Carl von Clausewitz: war is the extension of politics
[original: war is the continuation of politics by other means].</li>
<li>00:49:39 Border guards are the middle layer between military and
police (control of territorial boundaries VS maintaining territorial
integrity VS maintain security within the borders).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intelligence-services">Intelligence services</h3>
<ul>
<li>00:50:00 Intelligence services:</li>
<li>Classification: Intelligence service for proper and covert action</li>
<li>00:51:00 Similarities and differences to Journalism: Are
intelligence services also ad-driven?</li>
<li>00:51:48 Intelligence Agencies report only news that can be
actionable.</li>
<li>00:53:40 Domestic and Foreign Intelligence Services.</li>
<li>00:54:20 Objective reporting: Not mission driven, but report driven.</li>
<li>00:54:41 Two classes of intelligence services: Report requests
coming out of intelligence circle, or mission driven services
(Bundesverfassungsschutz, for example).</li>
<li>00:56:30 FBI: police organization plus intelligence aspect.</li>
<li>00:57:05 Intelligence services are about information, other services
are about action.</li>
<li>00:57:40 Staatsschutz and German Intelligence: police is for prevent
and investigate crimes.</li>
<li>00:59:05 Forensics is for police, subversive or maybe illegal
actions are for intelligence work. In Germany, it’s clearly
seperated; in USA, not so much.</li>
<li>01:02:15 CIA: Considered as Intelligence Agency. Gather information
is their mandate, not catch criminals.</li>
<li>01:05:10 Sending in intelligence to change things: huge toolkit to
act available.</li>
<li>01:05:50 Intelligence and Military Covert Actions are not Security,
but political action. However, it‘s a security issue for the other
side.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="international-organisations">International organisations</h3>
<ul>
<li>01:06:47 International Security Organizations (Europol, Interpol).
No police powers, limited investigation powers.</li>
<li>01:08:45 Working groups: example SIS (communicating warrants in EU).</li>
<li>01:09:58 Organizations: example Le Circle (high-ranking intelligence
chiefs), Munich Security Forum (conference with high-level security
chiefs).</li>
<li>01:15:00 Why is their image so skewed in the public? (The „Spy
Story“)</li>
<li>01:18:00 Rubicon Series (2010)</li>
<li>01:19:25 CSI Series (2000) - all about forensic analysis of crime
scenes, but in reality it‘s not the dominant part, only few
questions can be answered.</li>
<li>01:21:28 Playbook crime following the standard model VS outliers.</li>
<li>01:22:55 Being secretive about methods means keeping the advantage
from opponents: intelligence agencies VS intelligence agencies from
other countries; police VS criminals.</li>
<li>01:23:40 Sources 1) Scientific Fields: Criminalistics, Criminology.
(Education Material for people that train police, manuals and
coursework can be brought on Amazon, also check out libraries).</li>
<li>01:25:34 Sources 2) Reports: Indictments, Warrants (a lot are
public, depending on country). Caveat: contains successes and legal
processes only.</li>
<li>01:27:08 Sources 3) Private Conversation with Policemen,
Investigators, Intelligence People to get a more accurate picture
about their work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="public-private-partnerships">Public private partnerships</h3>
<ul>
<li>01:29:39 Private Security Services.</li>
<li>01:30:45 Cybercrime Investigations: Takedown of Cyberpunker 2 (200
servers in a German bunker).</li>
<li>01:32:25 Private Companies helping the police in Cybercrime
Investigation.</li>
<li>01:32:40 Analyzing digital evidence: Given to a lab from a private
company. (Cyberforensics, not done by police)</li>
<li>01:34:18 White-Collar Crime: Fraud, Commercial Fraud cases etc.
Corporate Investigators for hire: Forensic Accountants, etc. (Police
work only for special investigator power, or force powers.)</li>
<li>01:37:10 Corporations can use private security services when police
are bound legally (for example, in bribing), then sanatize the data
and give it to the police.</li>
<li>01:41:28 Informal communication lines&hellip; like in every other
industry. (But with special privileges: Police, Military,
Intelligence)</li>
<li>01:43:04 Presumably Cardinal Richelieu: „If you give me (three, or
two) six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will
find (seven reasons) something in them which will hang him.“, this
quote might be originated by memorialist Françoise Bertraut de
Motteville (1723), and was later paraphrased.</li>
<li>01:44:46 Real-life cases have a lot of ambiguity going on. It‘s a
work of probabilities, not a binary process.</li>
<li>01:45:45 Can you cover up a crime as a non-corrupt policeman?</li>
<li>01:46:50 Private Security Services exploit the ambiguity of
policework (someone bringing you from outside a full case, only
verification needed, negative evidence often gets lost).</li>
<li>01:48:21 Political Aspect: which crimes are deemed important?</li>
<li>01:49:20 Lobbying and capital power: Intellectual Property Crimes.</li>
<li>01:50:44 Industry identifies perpretators and delivers them to
police.</li>
<li>01:50:58 Filesharing: Machine investigating and filing reports,
backchanneling, automated sting operation (example, IP-Echelon).</li>
<li>01:56:08 Private Agencies provide: Analysis of evidence, production
of leads, investigation.</li>
<li>01:56:26 Money Laundering: not based on investigative results, but
on information provided by for example NGOs (example, Transparency
International).</li>
<li>01:59:28 Chain Analysis Companies produce risk scores for
Cryptocurrency Adresses (public keys).</li>
<li>02:01:05 Face recognition to identify suspects: example, Clearview
AI (finding people software)</li>
<li>02:02:20 Police relies on outside, unchecked influence: Private
Actors (non-illegmitate).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-intelligence">Private Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>02:03:25 Recap of Episode:
<ul>
<li>What outside input is influencing the police</li>
<li>Policy definition</li>
<li>Intelligence field</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>02:04:22 Tax crimes: special investigators who actively try to find
criminals.</li>
<li>02:04:39 Organized Crime: preventitive task of police (dismantling
organizations, Staatsschutz).</li>
<li>02:05:35 Civil Disobedience: infiltration by police and private
companies.</li>
<li>02:07:00 Private Security: 3 categories
<ul>
<li>private intelligence services</li>
<li>private security services</li>
<li>private military contractors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>02:09:38 Private Intelligence is information gathering.</li>
<li>02:09:53 Private Intelligence VS corporate espionage.</li>
<li>02:11:11 First example.</li>
<li>02:15:00 Why is there so much cheap spy tech for sale?</li>
<li>02:19:53 Second example: credit suisse incident.</li>
<li>02:21:12 Some serious health concerns for the operators and
middlemen (in-betweens).</li>
<li>02:24:05 Birds of a feather flock together: blurry lines of
corporate, state, and private decision makers (different sides of
the law).</li>
<li>02:26:29 Book/Thesis: Stephan Blancke (2011): Geheimdienstliche
Aktivitäten nicht-staatlicher Akteure (private intelligence
activities by non-state actors)</li>
<li>02:27:11 Private inflitrators, informants and agent provocateurs.</li>
<li>02:28:10 Extinction rebellion and very active activists.</li>
<li>02:30:30 Capture bounties.</li>
<li>02:32:45 A quiet business: private infiltration intelligence
services (IMSI-catchers) are often ex police, ex military etc.</li>
<li>02:34:40 Sharing information services between intelligence: 4 eyes,
14 eyes.</li>
<li>02:38:05 HCPP and game theory: will the cryptoanarchists ever get
something done?</li>
<li>02:39:00 Today’s security system is like antique byzantine, easy to
understand from outside, inside not easy to understand- even for the
players themselves.</li>
<li>02:40:25 Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road made agents run with money&mdash;is
it the only case, only in this direction?</li>
<li>02:42:00 State systems’ marketing: “protect and serve” by angels?
But, ACAB is also wrong.</li>
<li>02:45:55 Take personal responsibility for own security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>02:48:40 Developments/outlook: technologies that make globalization
possible, organizational technologies, reporting and communication.</li>
<li>02:50:25 Old days: reporting was sampling (today: big data, AI).</li>
<li>02:51:00 New incentive structures: financial markets. Old: financial
markets were not global, slow. Today: Global financial markets mean
indirect profit from activities like war, markets can be complex,
distributed, longer reach.</li>
<li>02:52:50 Even dumb criminals can use smart technologies (Dropgangs).</li>
<li>02:54:00 The mastermind/ intelligent criminals VS random criminals:
attribution becomes problematic (witness problem, no review
pointers).</li>
<li>02:57:24 Book: Evan Ratliff (2019): The Mastermind. Drugs. Empire.
Murder. Betrayal. (Paul LeRoux)</li>
